## Add checkout SDK

To start accepting payments using Lucid, you'll need to include the Lucid SDK library in your project. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://checkout.lucidconnect.xyz/lib.bundle.js"></script>
```

This script tag fetches the Lucid SDK library, making it available for use in your project.

## Initiate a Subscription

You can use the following code snippet to initiate a payment with Lucid:

```js
async function payWithLucid() {
  // Create a new instance of Lucid with your merchant keys
  const lucid = new Lucid({
    publicKey: `<- merchant public key ->`,
    privateKey: `<- merchant private key ->`,
  });

  // Use the Lucid instance to create a subscription
  await lucid.createSubscription({
    productId: `<- product identifier ->`,
    amount: 10, // Amount in USDC
    interval: 30, // Interval in days
  });
}
```

This method initiates the process of creating a subscription. It takes an object with three properties:

The `createSubscription` method is called on the Lucid instance, initiating the process of creating a subscription. It takes in the following properties:

<ResponseField name="productId" type="string" required>

<ResponseField name="amount" type="number" required>
