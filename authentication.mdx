## Introduction

Authentication is a crucial step in securing transactions and ensuring that sensitive data remains protected. Lucid employs a robust authentication system that relies on both the merchant's public and private keys. This documentation provides detailed information on how to use these keys effectively to ensure a secure payment process.

## Obtaining Your Merchant Keys

Your merchant keys are generated the first time you create your merchant account. They are available on the dashboard and are **only shown to you once**. Therefore, it's imperative to copy them immediately for safekeeping. Here's how you can generate new keys:

1. **Visit the Settings page**: Log in to your Lucid merchant account and navigate to the settings page.
2. **Generate your keys**: On the settings page, you will find your merchant keys displayed. Take note that they will be shown to you only once.
3. **Copy Your Keys**: Carefully copy both the public and private keys.

  Ensure that your private key is stored in a secure location and not shared
  publicly.

## Implementation

To authenticate with Lucid, you'll need to create a new instance of Lucid using the provided merchant keys. The code snippet below demonstrates this process:

```js
const lucid = new Lucid({
  publicKey: `<- public key ->`,
});
```

### Public Key

The public key is a unique identifier that is openly shared and used to verify the authenticity of requests. It serves as a reference for the Lucid system to identify the merchant making the request.

### Private Key

The private key is a confidential piece of information that should never be shared publicly. It is used to sign requests, providing a secure way to prove that a request indeed comes from the legitimate owner of the public key.
